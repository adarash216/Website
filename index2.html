        <h2>Key Environmental Laws Addressing Climate Change in India</h2>
        <p>
            India has enacted several laws and regulations to control pollution, protect natural resources, and promote
            sustainable development. Here are some key environmental laws in India related to climate change:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Environment (Protection) Act, 1986:</strong> Provides a framework for the protection and improvement of the environment, setting standards for emissions and pollutant discharge.</li>
            <li><strong>Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981:</strong> Aimed at controlling and reducing air pollution by regulating emissions from industrial and vehicular sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974:</strong> Focuses on preventing and controlling water pollution and maintaining water quality standards.</li>
            <li><strong>National Green Tribunal Act, 2010:</strong> Established the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to handle environmental cases, fast-tracking the legal process for environmental protection.</li>
            <li><strong>Forest Conservation Act, 1980:</strong> Restricts deforestation and regulates the use of forest land, promoting conservation and sustainable forestry practices.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy Conservation Act, 2001:</strong> Promotes energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy, helping reduce carbon emissions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These laws collectively create a regulatory structure to manage and mitigate the environmental impacts of India’s rapid growth and development.

        <h2>Impact of Environmental Laws on Climate Change in India</h2>
        <p>
            Environmental laws have had a substantial impact on India’s climate change efforts. By enforcing
            regulations on industries, promoting renewable energy, and establishing mechanisms for environmental
            protection, these laws help mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. Notable impacts include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>Energy Conservation Act</strong> has led to the establishment of the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), which promotes energy-saving measures across industries.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Air and Water Acts</strong> have contributed to reducing pollution levels in many industrial regions, improving air and water quality.</li>
            <li>The <strong>National Green Tribunal (NGT)</strong> has fast-tracked environmental cases, resulting in stricter enforcement and timely action against violations.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Forest Conservation Act</strong> has helped curb deforestation, protecting India's forests and biodiversity, which play a crucial role in carbon sequestration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            While challenges remain, these environmental laws are essential to India’s strategy for climate change adaptation and mitigation, and they continue to shape sustainable policies for the future.
