        <h2>Impact of Environmental Laws on Climate Change in India</h2>
        <p>
            India's environmental laws have been instrumental in addressing the impacts of climate change by promoting cleaner air, protecting forests, and encouraging sustainable development. Here are some significant impacts of these laws:

        <!-- Clean Energy Impact -->

            <h3>Promotion of Clean Energy</h3>
            <p>
                The <strong>Energy Conservation Act</strong> has led to an increase in energy efficiency standards and encouraged investments in renewable energy sources like solar and wind. This shift to renewable energy helps reduce India's reliance on fossil fuels, significantly cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

        <!-- Pollution Control Impact -->
        <div class="impact-item">

            <h3>Improved Pollution Control</h3>
            <p>
                The <strong>Air and Water Acts</strong> have helped reduce pollution in industrial regions by imposing stricter limits on emissions and effluent discharges. Cleaner air and water benefit public health and support Indiaâ€™s commitments to reduce carbon and other harmful emissions.

        <!-- Forest Conservation Impact -->
        <div class="impact-item">

            <h3>Forest and Biodiversity Conservation</h3>
            <p>
                The <strong>Forest Conservation Act</strong> has restricted deforestation and encouraged sustainable forestry practices. By protecting forests, India preserves its biodiversity and maintains carbon sinks, which play a crucial role in absorbing CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere.

        <!-- National Green Tribunal (NGT) -->
        <div class="impact-item">

            <h3>Effective Environmental Enforcement</h3>
            <p>
                The establishment of the <strong>National Green Tribunal (NGT)</strong> has led to more effective enforcement of environmental laws. The NGT addresses environmental cases swiftly, ensuring that industries comply with regulations and that environmental rights are upheld.
